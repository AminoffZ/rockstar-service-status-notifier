 When the status of a service changes there will be a sound and text notification. Keep in mind that it only works when the Rockstar Games' [services status page](https://support.rockstargames.com/servicestatus) is open. The refresh interval is set to 5 minutes by default and can at the moment only be changed by changing the first two variables in the script.js file.
